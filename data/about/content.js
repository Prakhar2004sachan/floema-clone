    text: "Valentina’s work plays around the surprise of what is possible to make with a simple and thin line: a thread.\n\n Coming from a family with a strong feminine tailoring tradition, she wanted to bring this passionate root into her jewellery world, finding new ways of working with textiles.\n\n She weaves freely thousands of meters of threads on a hydrosoluble fabric, cutting or interlacing them one with the other, to let unexpected connections appear.\n\n Her approach is both experimental and traditional: she likes to combine contemporary methods with ancient techniques, like Filigree.\n\n The latest work was chosen by the “Triennale Design Museum” in Milan to be part of the exhibition “W. Women in Italian design” (April 2016- February 2017).",

    text: `FLOEMA engages in its own small way to choose green solutions as much as possible.\n\n You will receive each piece in a handmade box realized by Florentine typography using eco-friendly paper (made by 90% of pure cellulose and 10% by cotton fibers),\n\n in a recycled and 100% recyclable parcel.\n\n The business cards are realized with recycled cotton fiber cardboard.\n All the pieces are created in a small laboratory in the Florentine countryside, preferring using green materials and recycling precious materials.`,
